# Bon-APPetit

This is my first project on Android application development. It is a simple food ordering app for a restaurant. This app along with the UI has been developed from scratch.
It has all the basic features of a simple Android app.

This app has been developed using JAVA as a programming language on Android Studio which is Google's official Android development software.
This app is fully equipped with its own database(SQlite) so that users can register and later sign in to the application to place their orders.
This app has various features such as Google Maps, for getting directions to the restaurant, calling feature and also a rating bar for feedback.
Users can choose not to register and can still view the menu. Password validation has also been taken care of and an alert dialog box has also been added.

The deatiled project report along with the system specifications and requirements and Data Flow Diagram can be found in the PDF file proj_report.pdf
The screen shots of the App in the working stage has also been added.
